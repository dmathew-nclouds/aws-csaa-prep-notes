## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

* A safe place to store your files.
* Object based (not block based) - photos, videos etc.
* Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities. (So it is durable)
* Files 0 Bytes - 5 TB.
* Files are stored in buckets (bucket ~ folder)
* There is unlimited storage
* Universal namespace, must be unique
* https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/skynyrd
* When file is uploaded, S3 returns 200 if successful
* 99.9% Availability Guarantee
* 99.999999999% durability guarantee for S3 information (eleven 9s)
* Tiered Storage Available
* Lifecycle Management
* Not suitable to install an operating system on
* Supports encryption
* Access control lists & bucket policies
* Charged for `Storage`, `Requests`, `Storage Management Pricing`, `Data Transfer Pricing`, `Transfer Acceleration`
* Global service
* Can restore file by deleting the `delete marker`.
* MFA Delete: Adds extra security level when trying to delete/change permission of an object (file).
__Transfer Acceleration__

Takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

### Data Consistency

* Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects (write)
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate) (delete - update)
* Update is atomic

---

* Simple key value store
* Key (Name of the object - filename) - `S3 lexicographicly sorts keys. Naming is quite important for design. e.g. if logs start with date, random string can be a prefix.`
* Value (Sequence of bytes)
* Version ID (versioning)
* Metadata
* Subresources
    * Access Control Lists
    * Torrent

---

### Encryption

* Client Side
* Server Side
  * Server side with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
  * Server side with KMS (SSE-KMS)
  * Server side with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
* Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL (Access control list) or using Bucket policies
* By default __Buckets are private and all objects stored inside them are private__

### S3 Tiers/Classes

* S3 - standard, fastest, 99.999999999% durable. Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and can sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
* S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed) - Cheaper. For less frequently requested data, but again rapid access guaranteed. Retrieval fee.
* Reduced Redundancy Storage - Less durable (%99.99), same availabilty. Cheaper. (Concurrent facility fault tolerance: 1)
* Glacier - Very cheap ($0.01 per gb for a month), used for archival only. Takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier
